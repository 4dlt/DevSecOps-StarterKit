# DevSecOps-StarterKit: Elevate Your CI/CD Security

Welcome to **DevSecOps-StarterKit**! This repository is your springboard to seamlessly infusing vital security checks into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Tailored for developers, especially those fresh to the security realm, we offer out-of-the-box templates for leading pipeline solutions: GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps Pipelines, and GitLab CI. Dive into our comprehensive suite of security analyses:

- **SAST (Static Application Security Testing):** Early detection of code vulnerabilities.
- **SCA (Software Composition Analysis):** Delving into open-source components to pinpoint potential risks.
- **IaC Scanning:** Proactively assessing Infrastructure as Code for misconfigurations and threats.
- **Docker Image Scans:** Guaranteeing the containers you roll out are devoid of known vulnerabilities.
- **Secret Scanning:** Catching unintentionally committed secrets and credentials before they become a liability.

Our mission is straightforward: to simplify the integration of baseline security checks, ensuring a robust and secure software delivery. Embrace, adapt, and bolster these templates to foster a safer coding environment!
