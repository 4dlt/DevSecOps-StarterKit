Welcome to **DevSecOps-StarterKit**! This repository is your springboard to seamlessly infusing vital security checks into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Tailored for developers, especially those fresh to the security realm, we offer out-of-the-box templates for leading pipeline solutions: GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps Pipelines, and GitLab CI. Dive into our comprehensive suite of security analyses:

Our mission is straightforward: to simplify the integration of baseline security checks, ensuring a robust and secure software delivery. Embrace, adapt, and bolster these templates to foster a safer coding environment!

# DevSecOps StarterKit üõ°Ô∏è

Welcome to the **DevSecOps StarterKit**! This repository serves as a launchpad for small teams and projects that might not have in-depth cybersecurity knowledge but understand the importance of integrating security into their development pipeline. By leveraging this kit, teams can seamlessly introduce robust security scanning into their CI/CD workflows.

## üåü Features:
- **Pre-configured Pipelines**: Ready-to-use configurations for popular CI/CD platforms: GitLab CI, Azure DevOps, and GitHub Actions.
- **Comprehensive Scans**: The kit incorporates a variety of security scans, including SAST, Dependency Scans, Image Scans, and Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) evaluations.
- **Flexibility**: Whether you're pulling from a public container registry, building a local image, or scanning infrastructure code, we've got you covered with optional steps and clear documentation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Included Security Scans:

### 1. **SAST Scan (Static Application Security Testing)**:
   - **Description**: SAST is a testing process that analyzes source code, bytecode, or binary code of your application for security vulnerabilities, typically without executing it. It helps identify areas where you may have used patterns known to be insecure.
   - **Tool Used**: [Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/)

### 2. **Dependency Scan**:
   - **Description**: Scans dependencies of your projects for known vulnerabilities. It ensures that the libraries and other dependencies you're using do not contain security flaws.
   - **Tool Used**: [OWASP Dependency-Check](https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck)

### 3. **Image Scan**:
   - **Description**: Scans Docker container images for vulnerabilities. Ensures that the underlying software and OS layers of your containers do not have known security issues.
   - **Tool Used**: [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy)

### 4. **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) Scan**:
   - **Description**: Analyzes your Infrastructure-as-Code templates for security misconfigurations and compliance violations. Ensures that your infrastructure provisioning scripts adhere to best security practices.
   - **Tool Used**: [Checkov](https://www.checkov.io/)

### 5. **Secrets Scan**:
   - **Description**: Scans the repository for secrets accidentally committed, like passwords, API keys, and tokens. Helps ensure that sensitive information is not inadvertently exposed.
   - **Tool Used**: [TruffleHog](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog)

Remember, each scan is important in its own way, addressing different aspects of application and infrastructure security. Using them in tandem ensures a more comprehensive security evaluation for your projects.

## üöÄ Getting Started:
1. Choose your platform directory (GitLab CI, Azure DevOps, or GitHub Actions).
2. Cpy the give template into your project files. No configuration is needed! :)
3. Integrate the pipeline configuration into your project, and you're set to have automated security scans with every code push!

## üí° Why DevSecOps?
Security is often treated as an afterthought, but with the rise in cyber threats, it's crucial to integrate security measures right from the development phase. DevSecOps bridges the gap between development and security, ensuring faster releases without compromising on security.
